Instructions for accessing the data set used in the paper "AW-Net: Automatic muscle structure analysis on B-mode ultrasound images for injury prevention".

We have provided two folders RyanCunningham and NeilCronin that contain, respectively, the datasets provided in the articles "Estimating Full Regional Skeletal Muscle Fibre Orientation from B-Mode Ultrasound Images Using Convolutional, Residual, and Deconvolutional Neural Networks" published by Ryan Cunningham et al. and "Automated Analysis of Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Images Using Deep Learning" published by Neil Cronin.

In each of these folders, you will find the folders :

1) images: contains the images of the dataset
2) fascicle_masks: contains the fascicle masks of the images
3) aponeurosis_masks: contains the aponeurosis masks of the images

Note : 
The fascicle masks and aponeurosis masks can be matched with the corresponding image by using the names of these files.

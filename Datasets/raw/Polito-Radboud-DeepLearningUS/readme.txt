METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
Images were acquired by experienced neurodiagnostic technicians (5-10+ years of experience), using an EsaoteÂ® MyLab Twice (Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy) device, with a 3-13 MHz linear broadband transducer and a fixed preset (gain 50%, general mid frequency setting, fixed depth of 40 or 60 mm depending on the muscle protocol, focus at 40 mm depth, image enhancers off). 

2. Methods for processing the data: 
Train new models or load and test uploaded models using main.py. Post-process outputs using EnsembleModel.m or post_process_muscleNet.m and extract performance using SegmentationMetrics.m 

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
Cuda capable GPU, MATLAB

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: /

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: requirements.txt

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: /

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:
